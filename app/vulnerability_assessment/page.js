Understanding the state of an organization's overall information system is ever more important now. This can be done with vulnerability assessments. A defensive-only approach to securing an enterprise is not sufficient. Best practice in information security acknowledges that. Existing defensive security mechanisms like firewalls and intrusion detection systems are not configured properly or are unable to locate all the new threats or network vulnerabilities, especially on the device level."}
